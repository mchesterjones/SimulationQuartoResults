## Research Question:

This simulation study will evaluate two missingness mechanisms at validation and compare methods for handling missing data at low outcome prevalence rates and different sample sizes to answer the question:

At implementation, how does missing data impact different sample sizes at low outcome prevalance rates?

## Methods

I performed a simulation study where I evaluated a range of different methods to handle missing data at deployment with low prevalence and sample size. I designed the study according to the ADEMP structured (\\cite{morris_evaluate_2019}) as detailed below.

## Aims

The primary aim of this study was to compare methods for handling missing data when the primary goal is deploying a prediciton model, under a range of missing data mechanisms (Missing Complete at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), Missing Not at Random (MNAR), with decrearsing levels of prevalence and a range of sample sizes. Performance was estimated and compared for each scenario.

Throughout this study, validation was assumed to be a direct replication of model deployment and therefore assumes the missingness mechanism and method for handling missing data remained the same across validation and deployment. Although this assumption fails with imputation with the outcome, which will be discussed.

1.  To determine the impact of missing data in one of five collected continuous variables in a logistic regression model

2.  To investigate methods for handling missing data applied at deployment and how that may affect the precision of the model

3.  To attain convergence at decreasing levels of prevalence

## Data-generating mechanisms

A logistic regression CPM to predict a binary outcome $Y$ was built for the development datasets generated for each outcome prevalence (10%, 5% and 1%) with five continuous predictors, \$\$ $X_1$ - $X_5$and $U$, where $U$ is unobserved. There was no missingness assumed in the development dataset and the sample size was fixed at 100,000. The dataset and corresponding model was only generated **once** because the focus here is on deployment.

The data-generating model for the validation (deployment) dataset contained outcome $Y$ and five predictors, $X_1$ - $X_5$and unobserved variable $U$ with missingness in only one predictor, $X_1$.The binary outcome $Y$ was always observed and the prevalence of $Y$ was varied across 10%, 5% and 1%, \\autroref. These prevalence were selected to represent increasing degrees of low prevalence with 1% being the most extreme. The sample sizes were selected as 500, 10,000 and 100,000 to give different extremes of validation sample size differentiation compared to the development.

I constructed three separate DAGs, \autoref{}, each representing MCAR, MAR (dependent on $X_2$) and MNAR (dependent on $X_1$, $X_2$ and $U$). In each DAG, $X_1*$ represents the observed part of $X_1$ and $R_1$ is the missing indicator.

Ifit the models on the development data and calculated the performance measures on the derived models applied to the validation datasets. Each simulated validation DGM was repeated for 200 iterations. The parameter values listed above result in a total of 108 parameter configurations (3 sample sizes, 3 missing data mechanisms, 3 outcome prevalences, four missing data methods).

Missing Data Handling Strategies

I considered four main methods for handling missing data the deployment, Complete Case Analysis, Mean Imputation, Multiple Imputation (MI) without the Outcome and MI with the outcome. MI was implemented using the **mice** package in R with five imputation sets.

**Target and performance measures**

The individual's predicted risk was the target. I will compare each method's ability to estimate using the following metrics of predictive performance, covering both calibration and discrimination **REF.**

\begin{itemize}

\item Calibration-in-the-large (CITL) - the intercept from a logistic regression model fitted to the observed outcome with the linear predictor as an offset.

\item Calibration slope -- the model coefficient of the linear predictor from a model fitted to the observed outcome with the linear predictor as the only explanatory variable.

\item Discrimination (Concordance/C-statistic) -- a measure of the discriminative ability of the fitted model. Defined as the probability that a randomly selected individual who experienced the outcome has a higher predicted probability than a patient that did not experience the outcome.

\item Brier score -- a measure of overall predictive accuracy, equivalent to the mean squared error of predicted probabilities

\end{itemization}

I also extract the obtained parameter estimates and any associated bias from each fitted CPM.

**Software**

All analyses were performed using R version 4.4.0 or greater (REF). The pROC library (REF) was used to calculate C-statistics and the mice package REF) was used for all imputations.
