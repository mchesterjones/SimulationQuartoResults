    "text": "2.3 Data-generating mechanisms\nData will be generated to create a development dataset to build the CPM (fully observed). This dataset and corresponding model will only be generated once because the focus here how methods to handle missing data at validation (mimicking implementation) affect model performance. The development dataset is fixed at 100,000 with prevalence 5%. I will develop a CPM based on logistic regression to model the binary outcome Y with five continuous predictors X1 -X5, Table 1.I include an unmeasured variable \\(U\\) that is also included in the CPM.\nThe second dataset will represent a validation study with missingness in only one predictor, \\(X_1\\).The binary outcome Y is always observed and the prevalence of Y will be varied across 10%, 5% and 1%, Table 1. These prevalence were selected to represent increasing degrees of low prevalence with 1% being the most extreme. The sample sizes were selected as 500, 10,000 and 100,000 to give different extremes of validation compared to the development.\nOne predictor, X1 is partially observed depending on the mechanism for missing data (i.e., the probability X1 is missing denoted \\(R_1\\)). The remaining predictors (X2 - X5) are fully observed. Only one predictor (X2 ) will have an effect on the likelihood of X1 being missing. The missing data is simulated under three scenarios, Missing-Completely-at-Random (MCAR), Figure 2.1 (a), Missing-at-Random (MAR), Figure 2.1 (b), and Missing-not-at-Random (MNAR), Figure 2.1 (c).

    "text": "3.1 Predictive Performance from Study 1 N=500 under Missing Completely at Random\nAt the smallest sample size, n=500. There were convergence issues where the outcome prevalence was lower (1% and 5%) and where Complete Case Analysis was used to handle the missing data as the sample size was reduced further. At missingness of 75%, almost half the simulations (46%) at 1% prevalence were unable to calculate the discrimination (AUC), calibration intercept and slope, Table 6.1.\n\n3.1.1 Brier Score\nThe Brier score ranges between 0 (perfect accuracy) and 1 (perfect inaccuracy). There was no difference in performance of the imputation methods in any scenario. The lowest brier scores occurred at lower outcome prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrier Score for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Discrimination\nThe discrimination was calculated as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Higher scores indicate better discrimination with 0.5 indicating the model is no better than chance.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 238 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Calibration in the Large and Calibration Slope\nThe Calibration was assessed through Calibration in the Large (CATL) and the Calibration Slope.\nThe ideal value of CATL is 0, which indicates perfect calibration, positive values indicate the model is underestimating the risk while negative values indicate overestimation. Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 241 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 241 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model. The lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence at n=500 under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe average performance

    "text": "4.0.1 Predictive Performance from Study 1 N=10,000 under Missing Completely at Random\n\n4.0.1.1 Brier Score\nThe Brier score ranges between 0 (perfect accuracy) and 1 (perfect inaccuracy). There was no difference in performance of the imputation methods in any scenario. The lowest brier scores occurred at lower outcome prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrier Score for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.1.2 Discrimination\nThe discrimination was calculated as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Higher scores indicate better discrimination with 0.5 indicating the model is no better than chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.1.3 Calibration in the Large and Calibration Slope\nThe Calibration was assessed through Calibration in the Large (CATL) and the Calibration Slope.\nThe ideal value of CATL is 0, which indicates perfect calibration, positive values indicate the model is underestimating the risk while negative values indicate overestimation. Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.2 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.3 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model. The lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\nBelow,

    "text": "5.1 Predictive Performance from Study 1 N=100,000 under Missing Completely at Random\n\n5.1.1 Brier Score\nThe Brier score ranges between 0 (perfect accuracy) and 1 (perfect inaccuracy). There was no difference in performance of the imputation methods in any scenario. The lowest brier scores occurred at lower outcome prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrier Score for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Discrimination\nThe discrimination was highest for the CCA method under each scenario and averaged between 0.77 and 0.78 under each scenario. At all levels of missingness in the predictor, the multiple imputation methods had the lowest discrimination under each prevalence. The variation in the discrimination between methods was highest at 5% and 10% prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Calibration in the Large and Calibration Slope\nThe Calibration was assessed through Calibration in the Large (CATL) and the Calibration Slope.\nThe ideal value of CATL is 0, which indicates perfect calibration, positive values indicate the model is underestimating the risk while negative values indicate overestimation. Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model. The lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing Completely at Random\n\n\n\n\nBelow,

    "text": "6.0.1 Predictive Performance from Study 1 N=500 under Missing at Random\nAt the smallest sample size, n=500. There were convergence issues where the outcome prevalence was lower (1% and 5%) and where Complete Case Analysis was used to handle the missing data as the sample size was reduced further. At missingness of 75%, almost half the simulations (46%) at 1% prevalence were unable to calculate the discrimination (AUC), calibration intercept and slope, Table 6.1.\n\n6.0.1.1 Brier Score\nThe Brier score ranges between 0 (perfect accuracy) and 1 (perfect inaccuracy). There was no difference in performance of the imputation methods in any scenario. The lowest brier scores occurred at lower outcome prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrier Score for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.1.2 Discrimination\nThe discrimination was calculated as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Higher scores indicate better discrimination with 0.5 indicating the model is no better than chance.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 195 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.1.3 Calibration in the Large and Calibration Slope\nThe Calibration was assessed through Calibration in the Large (CATL) and the Calibration Slope.\nThe ideal value of CATL is 0, which indicates perfect calibration, positive values indicate the model is underestimating the risk while negative values indicate overestimation. Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 197 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 197 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.2 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.3 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model. The lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe average performance measures across 100 simulations are summarised in Table 6.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Performance Measures at N=500 under MAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nMethod to handle missing

The lowest brier scores occurred at lower outcome prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrier Score for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0.1.2 Discrimination\nThe discrimination was calculated as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Higher scores indicate better discrimination with 0.5 indicating the model is no better than chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0.1.3 Calibration in the Large and Calibration Slope\nThe Calibration was assessed through Calibration in the Large (CATL) and the Calibration Slope.\nThe ideal value of CATL is 0, which indicates perfect calibration, positive values indicate the model is underestimating the risk while negative values indicate overestimation. Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0.2 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0.3 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model. The lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nBelow, Table 7.1

There was no difference in performance of the imputation methods in any scenario. The lowest brier scores occurred at lower outcome prevalence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrier Score for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Discrimination\nWhen missingness is lowest (25%), there is limited difference between the methods. Under each scenario, the multiple imputation methods have almost identical AUC. The multiple imputation methods had the lowest discrimination in each scenario and was most affected by missingness.

Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model.

    "text": "9.1 Sample size N=500\nAt the smallest sample size, n=500. There were convergence issues where the outcome prevalence was lower (1% and 5%) and where Complete Case Analysis was used to handle the missing data as the sample size was reduced further. At missingness of 75%, more than half of the simulations at 1% prevalence were unable to calculate the discrimination (AUC) (53%), calibration intercept (53%) and slope (53%). This is broken down in Table 9.1 at the end of the page.\n\n9.1.0.1 Brier Score\nThe Brier score ranges between 0 (perfect accuracy) and 1 (perfect inaccuracy).\nThe average for all senarios under MNAR at n=500 were under 0.1 with lower prevalence having higher accuracy. In all scenarios there was significant overlap of the confidence intervals for all methods and CCA consistently had the lowest average Brier Score.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrier Score for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.0.2 Discrimination\nThe discrimination was calculated as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Higher scores indicate better discrimination with 0.5 indicating the model is no better than chance.\nThe highest average discrimination was associated with higher outcome prevalences at 5% and 10%. Wide confidence intervals were observed for CCA and 1% outcome prevalence . This was also observed under the highest amount of missingness (75%).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 259 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC for each combination of prevalence at n=500 under Missing Not at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.0.3 Calibration in the Large and Calibration Slope\nCalibration was assessed through calibration-in-the-large and the calibration slope.\nThe ideal value of calibration-in-the-large is 0, which indicates perfect calibration, positive values indicate the model is underestimating the risk while negative values indicate overestimation. Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\nWorse calibration was observed at higher missingness. At 25% missing values, CCA performed the best, however it was affected most by high missingness (CCA&lt;0 when missingness 50% or 75% and outcome prevlance 5% and 75% ) Multiple imputation and mean imputation had similar calibration across scenarios except where prevalence 1% and missingness 50% which may be due to the number of simulations which did not converge (56%)\n\n\nWarning: Removed 264 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\nCCA was consistently the closest average to 1 followed by mean imputation although the averages were very similar and there were wide overlapping confidence intervals.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 264 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.1 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\nAt 10% and 5% outcome prevalence, the bias of CCA became increasingly negative and further from 0, mean imputation was also biased with the lowest and similar bias observed in the multiple imputation methods. At 1% prevalence there was no noticeable difference between the bias.\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model.\nThe lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error as did CCA in each scenario although with wide overlapping confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.1:

However, the range of the AUC varied very little between the lowest at 10% prevalance, 75% missingness and MI without the outcome (0.73 95% CI 0.71, 0.75) and the highest at 1% prevalance, 25% missingness and CCA (0.78 95% CI 0.71, 0.84), with large overlap in the confidence intervals at each method under each scenario. The CCA method had the highest average for each scenario however it also had the largest variability, ?fig-auc.\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC for each combination of prevalence at n=10,000 under under Missing Not at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.0.3 Calibration in the Large and Calibration Slope\nThe Calibration was assessed through Calibration in the Large (CATL) and the Calibration Slope.\nThe ideal value of CATL is 0, which indicates perfect calibration, positive values indicate the model is underestimating the risk while negative values indicate overestimation. Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model. The lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nBelow, Table 10.1

Larger deviations from 0 suggest poorer calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration in the Large for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal value of the Calibration Slope is 1 indicating perfect calibration across all risk levels. Values less than 1 suggest overfitting (predictions are too extreme), while values greater than 1 suggest underfitting (predictions are too conservative). Values that differ significantly from 1 indicate poor calibration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration Slope for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.4 Bias\nThe Bias was assessed for each simulation (where 0 indicates no bias and the model estimates are on average equal to the true values).\n\n\n\n\n\nBias for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.5 Root Mean Square Error\nThe RMSE was assessed for each simulation where lower error indicates a better fit of the model. The lowest prevalence simulations (1%) had the lowest mean square error.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE for each combination of prevalence, sample size, missingness under Missing at Random\n\n\n\n\nBelow, Table 11.1
